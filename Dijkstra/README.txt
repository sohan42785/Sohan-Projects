Assignment7

Assignment7: This is the main file that takes the user inputs and calls the correct methods needed.

Graph.h: This file declares all the methods that are gonna be used in the Graph.cpp file.

Graph.cpp: This file is responsible for finding the shortest path/length from start to finish.

LinkedList.h: This header file just creates the structure for the linkedList and declares 
			methods that are gonna be used in the LinkedList.cpp file.

LinkedList.cpp: This file implements all the methods declared in the header file so
			that they can be implemented in the graph

MinHeap.h: Declares all the methods so that they can later be implemented into the Graph

MinHeap.cpp: This implements all the declared methods from the MinHeap.h file
